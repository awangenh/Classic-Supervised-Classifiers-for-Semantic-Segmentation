# Tools for Classic Supervised Color-Texture Segmentation and Rersults Analysis

This repository contains the software used for the experiments published in this paper.
This software was build aiming the utilization and comparison of classical machine learning supervised classifiers in the semantic segmentation of agricultural aerial images. The code was written in c++ utilizing the OpenCV library.

# Usage

There are three executable tools in this repository: imgSeg, precisionCal, and decisionBoundaries.

## imgSeg

With this tool you can segment a list of images, specifying the wanted classifier, feature vector, and train data. There are some example yml files that can be used to configure the tool. 

The images belo show an example of color-texture image segmentation employing gabor filters and several different classifiers.

The first image presents the original image and the manually selected class examples (hence supervised segmentation), shown as pixels selected with a paint tool:

The second image shows the results with different classifiers (the columns) and different texture descriptors (the rows):

These 10 combinations of texure descritptors and classifiers are available in the code of this git.

## precisionCal

This tool computes, for a list of results and their respective ground truths, two precision measures (F1 score and Jaccard index), and saves this data in a yml file.

## decisionBoundaries

This is a usefull tool to analize the behaviour of each classifier. The user can draw a bi-dimensional train data, and the software computes de decision boundaries for several classifiers. The next image shows some examples.
